This is my tenth week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. It's exactly 1 month left to finish the challenge.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: “[Week 09 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapauladsmendes.github.io/week-09-100-days-of-code/)” .

Day 64 - I read "Guys, REST APIs are not Databases", "API to Database? ", "How does it feel to be a junior developer" and "Como ser o programador Junior que toda empresa quer contratar".

Day 65 - I read "Create a Django API in Under 20 Minutes" and "Git series 3/3: Mastering git rebase".

Day 66 - I studied about bots for Twitter.

Day 67 - I studied Deterministic Finite Automata and I did exercises about Regular Language ​​to construct Regular Grammar and Finite Deterministic Automata.

Day 68 - I coded in my job only. And I need to do a software engineering homework of the University, so that's my challenge today too. Studying, working, being part of a project, classes of English and challenge of code is not easy, but I'm persisting.

Day 69 - I coded a work on analysis common users of Github hireable by location - Clique Problem using the Github API and I did the first exercise with Python of discipline topics of bioinformatics, DNA to RNA transcription.

Day 70 - I coded in my work on analysis common users of Github hireable by location - Clique Problem using the Github API again and I refactored the code.
