This is my sixth week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. This week I contributed a lot with open source code. It has been very gratifying to apply the knowledge I have gained through months of hard work. I am happy with my studies and I hope to complete the challenge.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: “[Week 05 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapaulamendes.github.io/week-05-100-days-of-code/)” .

Day 36 - I studied Classes of Python, I read the article: 'Change a django password manually', and I finished my slides for my Python workshop.

Day 37 - I added exercises and a mini project on the slides of my Python workshop. In addition, I resolved all the exercises and the mini project. I made it available on my github to share and take doubts.

Day 38 - I opened a pull request on the repository of website https://python.org.br/ . I also taught a Python workshop at the University.

Day 39 - I helped a girl make her first blog in the morning. In the afternoon I attended the meeting of the [Colaboradados](https://colaboradados.github.io/). In the evening I refactored the code of the [Colaboradados](https://colaboradados.github.io/) website. Before the website wasn't using the templates to only generate markdown, I fixed that and applied good practices.

Day 40 - This week was completely dedicated to collaboration with open source. In this day my PR on the Python Brasil wiki was approved. And I put more content in [Colaboradados](https://colaboradados.github.io/).

Day 41 - I learned a little more about validation of files with JavaScript. I also sent one more PR to the Python Brasil wiki. And I fixed one more thing in [Colaboradados](https://colaboradados.github.io/). I am proud of being applying the knowledge I am getting.

Day 42 - I sent another PR to the Python Brasil wiki. I fixed the django version in my repositories. And I attended another Her Voice English class.
