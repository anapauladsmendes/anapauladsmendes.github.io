This is my ninth week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I have learned a lot and applied my knowledge.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: “[Week 08 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapaulamendes.github.io/week-08-100-days-of-code/)” .

Day 57 - I contributed with open source fixing some issues of the site PyLadies Brazil.

Day 58 - I tried to understand how Ajax works and I tried to fix another issue of PyLadies Brazil that is more hard, I haven't finished this issue.

Day 59 - I read "How to Work With AJAX Request With Django".

Day 60 - I read "Django and AJAX Form Submissions - Say 'Goodbye' to the Page Refresh" and "Django and AJAX Form Submissions - More Practice" and I fixed a issue on the [**Colaboradados**](https://colaboradados.github.io/) website.

Day 61 - I read "Working With JSON Data in Python" and I updated my resume, my website and my Linkedin.

Day 62 - I read "How to use git efficiently", "Git series 1/3: Understanding git for real by exploring the .git directory" and "Git series 2/3: rebase and the golden rule explained".

Day 63 - I contributed with the [**Colaboradados**](https://twitter.com/colaboradados).
