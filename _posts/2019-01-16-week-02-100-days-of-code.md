This is my second week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. The first week I had a performance far beyond what I expected. This week was a bit harder to keep up, because I had urgent health problems, but I'm better.

From now on I will summarize the subjects I studied during the week in a more concise way since I presented my motivations in the first post "[Week 01 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapauladsmendes.github.io/week-01-100-days-of-code/)".

Day 8 - I read Django Tips about 'Optimize Database Queries' and I read a part of 'QuerySet API reference' from the Django documentation.

Day 9 - I finished 'QuerySet API reference' from the Django documentation and I learned about packages of Node and how I do a package.json.

Day 10 - I learned how to send simple emails, with attachments and with a contact list using Python with the 'smtplib' library.

Day 11 - I read about 'How to Write Beautiful Python Code with PEP 8' and I learned some of the main good practices for writing a readable code with Python. It's amazing how much these conventions help us get a better reading of a code.

Day 12 - I programmed a lot with the tasks of my internship. I had tasks to fix the html/css of a website, so I was front-end. I did not have time to do an extra study because unforeseen events happened and I went to the hospital.

Day 13 - I studied JavaScript HTML DOM: Intro, Methods, Document, Elements, HTML, CSS, Animations, Events, Event Listener, Navigation, Nodes, Collections and Node Lists. I studied Checkbox and Axios too.

Day 14 - I read about Django Cors because I needed it on my internship. And everything I read about JavaScript HTML DOM helped me to solve the tasks of my internship.
