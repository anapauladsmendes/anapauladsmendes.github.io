This is my last week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: “[Week 13 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapaulamendes.github.io/week-13-100-days-of-code/)” .

Day 92 - I added the icon for our [@**colaboradados**](https://twitter.com/colaboradados) donation campaign. And today, too, I coded with Java because of a exercise of the university, and I didn't remember anymore of Java.

Day 93 - I, [@**dii_lua**](https://twitter.com/dii_lua) and [@**juditecypreste**](https://twitter.com/juditecypreste) made a call on Zoom to create new categories in the blog of [@**colaboradados**](https://twitter.com/colaboradados) and I taught some good practices of Git for them.

Day 94 - I studied Languages ​​and Grammar, Regular Languages ​​and Properties of Regular Languages ​​of Computer Theory.

Day 95 - I did exercises on Languages ​​and Grammar, Regular Languages ​​and Properties of Regular Languages ​​of Computer Theory.

Day 96 - I read about values( ) of querysets on Django.

Day 97 - I read about The Role of Algorithms in Computing, Insertion sort, Analyzing algorithms, Designing algorithms and Growth of Functions. This corresponds to 3 chapters of the book Introduction to Algorithms, Thomas H. Cormen.

Day 98 - I read about Divide-and-Conquer. This corresponds the chapter 4 of the book Introduction to Algorithms, Thomas H. Cormen.

Day 99 - I did an initial website with Jekyll for a University Software Engineering work. ([https://plataformasuniversitarias.github.io/](https://t.co/1ET9cPNfjg "https://plataformasuniversitarias.github.io/") )

Day 100 - It was my last day of the challenge. I am very proud of my growth during the challenge. For the last day I did code review of the University's Software Engineering work and my colleague and I saw how to implement a form in Jekyll.
