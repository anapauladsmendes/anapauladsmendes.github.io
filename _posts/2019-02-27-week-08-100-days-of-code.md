This is my eighth week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I've gone over half the 100 days and feel like I've improved a lot as a developer in many ways.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: “[Week 07 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapauladsmendes.github.io/week-07-100-days-of-code/)” .

Day 50 - I read "VIM and Python – A Match Made in Heaven".

Day 51 - I learned about Sweet Alert 2 of JavaScript.

Day 52 - I taught a little Python and Pandas to my sister-in-law.

Day 53 - I studied: Computer Theory ("Languages ​​and Grammar" and "Regular Grammar") and Design and Analysis of Algorithms ("Algorithms", "Elementary Operations" and "Growth Order") and I did my homework of the English course.

Day 54 - I studied a bit about Django Templates, but I still want to understand more about it.

Day 55 - I studied about Clique, an NP-hard problem.

Day 56 - I studied about Clique again, an NP-hard problem. And I had two University's works to do and they are gave me hard work.
