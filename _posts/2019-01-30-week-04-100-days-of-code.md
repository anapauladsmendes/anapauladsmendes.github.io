This is my fourth week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. So today I completed a month of challenge! TODAY IS THE DAY! >.<

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: "[Week 03 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapaulamendes.github.io/week-03-100-days-of-code/)" .

Day 22 - I have fixed the responsiveness of my personal blog and SEO. Many elements that weren't responsive still needed improvement, but I gradually fixed it.

Day 23 -  I improved the CSS of my personal blog. In the weekend I devoted myself to correct many things in it and apply good programming practices that I am learning at work.

Day 24 - I have improved the CSS responsive of my personal blog even more. I updated information, removed useless links, improved the SEO even more. Now it works well on mobile phones.

Day 25 - I read the article '8 Tips for Great Code Reviews'. In addition to knowing how to code, sounds good have good practices.

Day 26 - I read about 'Accordion' of Zurb Foundation and I implemented in the my job. For my extra study I read 4 #DjangoTips: 'How to Get the Current URL Within a Django Template', 'Blank or Null', 'How to Create a Change Password View' and 'AuthenticationForm Custom Login Policy'.

Day 27 - I added a donation button on my personal blog and started the course 'Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)' of
FreeCodeCamp. I did the topic 'Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5'. Each topic has an average of 37.5 hours.

Day 28 - I read this wonderful post: 'The 7 Myths of Learning to Code' and I contributed to the [Colaboradados](https://colaboradados.github.io/) solving some issues.
