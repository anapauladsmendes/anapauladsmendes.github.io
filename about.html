		I have a huge passion for teaching and sharing knowledge as much as I can. I believe that information in the right hands has the power to move the world and offer better conditions for society. I am continually cultivating other women with tech mentorship. I love participating in the Python Brasil community since I co-founded PyLadies Teresina in 2016.
