<div class="aboutme">
	<p class="description">
		I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer and have experience as a Developer Consultant. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Universidade Federal do Piauí and a technical certification in Software Development from Instituto Federal de Ciência e Tecnologia do Piauí. My areas of expertise are in Software Development and Artificial Intelligence.

		I have a huge passion for teaching and sharing knowledge as much as I can. I believe that information in the right hands has the power to move the world and offer better conditions for society. I am continually cultivating other women with tech mentorship. I love participating in the Python Brasil community since I co-founded PyLadies Teresina in 2016.
